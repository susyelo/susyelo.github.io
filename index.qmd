## About me

As a data scientist, I apply my expertise in using large, complex datasets and multiple data-science approaches to explore patterns of public health coverage across the globe, as well as understanding the complex relationships between biodiversity, environment, and human impact. I have over ten years of experience in conducting and publishing cutting-edge research in the field of public health and life science, using various tools and methods in data analysis, GIS, and statistical modelling, particularly with R programming.

My mission is to deepen the scientific understanding of the dynamic connections between biodiversity, environmental change, and human health, while supporting the development of impactful public health and conservation policies. I have collaborated with multiple academic and non-academic partners, such as Imperial College London, GAVI, BMGF, the Natural History Museum, and NSF, among others, to support interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral projects that address global challenges and opportunities in biodiversity and health.
