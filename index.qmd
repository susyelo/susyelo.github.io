I'm a Public Health and Environmental Research Consultant. I use large, complex datasets and multiple data-science approaches to explore patterns of public health coverage across the globe, as well as understanding the complex relationships between biodiversity, environment, and human impact. 

I have over ten years of experience in conducting and publishing cutting-edge research in the field of public health and life science, using various tools and methods in data analysis, GIS, and statistical modelling, particularly with R programming.
