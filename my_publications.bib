  year      = {2023},
  abstract  = {Background 

There have been notable declines in immunisation coverage across the globe due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recovery has begun but is geographically variable; many regions are still experiencing serious disruption. This will lead to under-immunised cohorts and interrupt progress in reducing vaccine-preventable disease burden. This study aims to quantify the impacts of coverage disruption on routine and campaign immunisation services, identify cohorts and regions that may particularly benefit from catch-up activities, and determine what losses in coverage can be recovered.

Methods & Results

We present vaccine impact projections for 14 pathogens in 112 low- and-middle income countries (LMICs); we further examine a subset of outbreak-prone or priority diseases and catch-up vaccination activities. We projected vaccination coverage in the absence of disruptions, with nonlinear recovery following disruption and/or with catch-up vaccination activities. 

We estimate that disruption to measles, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV), Hepatitis B, Meningitis A, and yellow fever (YF) vaccination could lead to 49,119 (95% [17,248, 134,941]) additional deaths over calendar years 2020-2030, largely due to measles. For years of vaccination 2020-2030 for 14 pathogens we found disruption leads to a 2.66% (95% [2.52, 2.81]) reduction in long-term impact. We project that catch-up activities could avert 78.9% (95% [40.2%, 119.6%]) of excess deaths between calendar years 2023-2030.

Implications

Our results highlight the importance of timing catch-up activities and the need for a global concerted efforts and strong political commitment in immunisation services given projected burden in order to improve vaccine coverage in affected cohorts. Excess burden for measles and YF occurs swiftly after disruption, but we found mitigation measures to be effective for both. Additionally, the high long-term impact of HPV vaccine as an important cervical cancer prevention tool warrants continued immunisation efforts following disruption. Importantly, we emphasise that increased immunisation efforts have the ability to mitigate further losses.

  abstract = {Despite vaccination being one of the most effective public health interventions, there are persisting inequalities and inequities in immunisation. Understanding the differences in subnational vaccine impact can help improve delivery mechanisms and policy. We analyse subnational vaccination coverage of measles first-dose (MCV1) and estimate patterns of inequalities in impact, represented as deaths averted, across 45 countries in Africa. We also evaluate how much this impact would improve under more equitable vaccination coverage scenarios. Using coverage data for MCV1 from 2000–2019, we estimate the number of deaths averted at the first administrative level. We use the ratio of deaths averted per vaccination from two mathematical models to extrapolate the impact at a subnational level. Next, we calculate inequality for each country, measuring the spread of deaths averted across its regions, accounting for differences in population. Finally, using three more equitable vaccination coverage scenarios, we evaluate how much impact of MCV1 immunisation could improve by (1) assuming all regions in a country have at least national coverage, (2) assuming all regions have the observed maximum coverage; and (3) assuming all regions have at least 80% coverage. Our results show that progress in coverage and reducing inequality has slowed in the last decade in many African countries. Under the three scenarios, a significant number of additional deaths in children could be prevented each year; for example, under the observed maximum coverage scenario, global MCV1 coverage would improve from 76% to 90%, resulting in a further 363(95%CrI:299–482) deaths averted per 100,000 live births. This paper illustrates that estimates of the impact of MCV1 immunisation at a national level can mask subnational heterogeneity. We further show that a considerable number of deaths could be prevented by maximising equitable access in countries with high inequality when increasing the global coverage of MCV1 vaccination.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, vaccination programmes for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) have expanded across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the rise of COVID-19 resulted in global disruption to routine immunisation activities. Such disruptions could have a detrimental effect on public health, leading to more deaths from VPDs, particularly without mitigation efforts. Hence, as routine immunisation activities resume, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of different approaches for recovery. We apply an impact extrapolation method developed by the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium to estimate the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions with different recovery scenarios for ten VPDs across 112 LMICs. We focus on deaths averted due to routine immunisations occurring in the years 2020–2030 and investigate two recovery scenarios relative to a no-COVID-19 scenario. In the recovery scenarios, we assume a 10% COVID-19-related drop in routine immunisation coverage in the year 2020. We then linearly interpolate coverage to the year 2030 to investigate two routes to recovery, whereby the immunization agenda (IA2030) targets are reached by 2030 or fall short by 10%. We estimate that falling short of the IA2030 targets by 10% leads to 11.26% fewer fully vaccinated persons (FVPs) and 11.34% more deaths over the years 2020–2030 relative to the no-COVID-19 scenario, whereas, reaching the IA2030 targets reduces these proportions to 5% fewer FVPs and 5.22% more deaths. The impact of the disruption varies across the VPDs with diseases where coverage expands drastically in future years facing a smaller detrimental effect. Overall, our results show that drops in routine immunisation coverage could result in more deaths due to VPDs. As the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions is dependent on the vaccination coverage that is achieved over the coming years, the continued efforts of building up coverage and addressing gaps in immunity are vital in the road to recovery.},

   abstract = {<p> Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases of species’ threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local‐scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the <styled-content style="fixed-case">PREDICTS</styled-content> project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems – <ext-link href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html">https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html</ext-link> ). We make site‐level summary data available alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015. </p>},

  abstract = {Background
There have been declines in global immunisation coverage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recovery has begun but is geographically variable. This disruption has led to under-immunised cohorts and interrupted progress in reducing vaccine-preventable disease burden. There have, so far, been few studies of the effects of coverage disruption on vaccine effects. We aimed to quantify the effects of vaccine-coverage disruption on routine and campaign immunisation services, identify cohorts and regions that could particularly benefit from catch-up activities, and establish if losses in effect could be recovered.

Methods
For this modelling study, we used modelling groups from the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium from 112 low-income and middle-income countries to estimate vaccine effect for 14 pathogens. One set of modelling estimates used vaccine-coverage data from 1937 to 2021 for a subset of vaccine-preventable, outbreak-prone or priority diseases (ie, measles, rubella, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus [HPV], meningitis A, and yellow fever) to examine mitigation measures, hereafter referred to as recovery runs. The second set of estimates were conducted with vaccine-coverage data from 1937 to 2020, used to calculate effect ratios (ie, the burden averted per dose) for all 14 included vaccines and diseases, hereafter referred to as full runs. Both runs were modelled from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2100. Countries were included if they were in the Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance portfolio; had notable burden; or had notable strategic vaccination activities. These countries represented the majority of global vaccine-preventable disease burden. Vaccine coverage was informed by historical estimates from WHO–UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage and the immunisation repository of WHO for data up to and including 2021. From 2022 onwards, we estimated coverage on the basis of guidance about campaign frequency, non-linear assumptions about the recovery of routine immunisation to pre-disruption magnitude, and 2030 endpoints informed by the WHO Immunization Agenda 2030 aims and expert consultation. We examined three main scenarios: no disruption, baseline recovery, and baseline recovery and catch-up.

Findings
We estimated that disruption to measles, rubella, HPV, hepatitis B, meningitis A, and yellow fever vaccination could lead to 49 119 additional deaths (95% credible interval [CrI] 17 248–134 941) during calendar years 2020–30, largely due to measles. For years of vaccination 2020–30 for all 14 pathogens, disruption could lead to a 2·66% (95% CrI 2·52–2·81) reduction in long-term effect from 37 378 194 deaths averted (34 450 249–40 241 202) to 36 410 559 deaths averted (33 515 397–39 241 799). We estimated that catch-up activities could avert 78·9% (40·4–151·4) of excess deaths between calendar years 2023 and 2030 (ie, 18 900 [7037–60 223] of 25 356 [9859–75 073]).

Interpretation
Our results highlight the importance of the timing of catch-up activities, considering estimated burden to improve vaccine coverage in affected cohorts. We estimated that mitigation measures for measles and yellow fever were particularly effective at reducing excess burden in the short term. Additionally, the high long-term effect of HPV vaccine as an important cervical-cancer prevention tool warrants continued immunisation efforts after disruption.
